👋 Hi, I’m **@aleksanterix**

🏢 Currently working as an Tech support engineer and Junior software developer. 

👀 Interested in quantitative research of the financial markets and developing bots. At work, I primarily work on backend web development. 

💹 I prioritize high ROI tasks, over working hard on working hard. If GPT can do it, let GPT do it.
